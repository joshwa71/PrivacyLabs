# Ask Claude for rewrites

 __Suggest Edits

If Claude gives a response that is close to, but not quite what you're looking
for, you can ask Claude to rewrite it.

In Slack this can be as simple as telling Claude to "Try again" after it gives
an unsatisfactory response. (It will of course perform better at the rewrite
if you give it more direction like "Please rewrite that to include more
detail.") Unless you send a `/reset` command first, your message is added to
the existing context window. This allows Claude to process its previous answer
as part of the prompt.

You must always include the previously generated text in your prompt if you
send it through the API (including calling the CLAUDE or CLAUDEFREE functions
with Claude in Sheets). Here's an example prompt template:

Good Prompt

    
    
    
    Human: Here's a paragraph:
    <paragraph>
    {{PARAGRAPH}}
    </paragraph>
    
    I'd like you to rewrite it using the following instructions:
    <instructions>
    {{INSTRUCTIONS}}
    </instructions>
    
    Please put your rewrite in <rewrite></rewrite> tags.
    
    Assistant: <rewrite>
    

For lower volume use cases the paragraph to be rewritten can just be pasted in
place of `{{PARAGRAPH}}`. To automate this you can set up a prompt chain so
that Claude's response to a previous prompt gets substituted for the
{{PARAGRAPH}} placeholder in this prompt.

If you are using Claude in Sheets it's possible to set up rows in your Sheet
such that in each row a different set of instructions is substituted for the
{{INSTRUCTIONS}} placeholder. You can generate multiple types of rewrites at
once this way.
