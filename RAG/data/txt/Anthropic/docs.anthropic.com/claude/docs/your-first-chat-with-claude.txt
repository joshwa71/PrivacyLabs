Claude is capable of many things, and how well it responds to you can depend
on how you ask it questions. Whether via Slack or our web interface, here is
some general advice on your first few conversations.

#

Talk to Claude like a contractor

Speak to Claude like a contractor you‚Äôve hired, _not_ like a bare text
completion API. For example:

Bad Prompt

    
    
    An ingenious researcher wrote a summary of laser optics technology, writing:
    

This will not work well to prompt Claude. Imagine you walked up to someone and
said this. How might they respond? A little confused, perhaps.

Instead, just directly ask Claude for what you want:

Good Prompt

    
    
    Write an expert-level summary of laser optics technology.
    

#

Claude "remembers" entire threads

When interacting with Claude through Slack or our web interface, it can see
anything else you wrote in the thread.

It can‚Äôt remember anything else you said prior to this thread (eg other
threads, even if simultaneous). Its memory is cleared between threads.

Limitations to keep in mind

  * üé≠ Claude is ‚Äúplaying a role‚Äù as a helpful assistant. It will often incorrectly report its own abilities, or claim to be ‚Äúupdating its memory‚Äù, when in fact it does not have any memory of prior conversations!
  * ‚ûó Claude will often make mistakes with complicated arithmetic and reasoning, and sometimes with more basic tasks. If given a long list of instructions it will often make mistakes when attempting to comply with all of them, but see Break complex tasks into subtasks and Prompt Chaining for some workarounds.
  * üëª Claude still sometimes hallucinates or makes up information and details. It will sometimes fill in information from its memory that isn‚Äôt present in long documents it‚Äôs presented with when asked questions.
  * üåê Claude has read a lot on the internet, so it knows things about the real world‚Ä¶ but it does **not** have internet access.
  * ‚è≥ Claude was trained on data that can be up to 2 years out of date.
  * üìÖ Similarly, Claude does not know today‚Äôs date, nor does it know about current events.
  * üî® It cannot (yet!) take actions in the real world ‚Äî _but it can suggest actions to take._
  * üìá It cannot (yet!) look things up ‚Äî _but it can suggest what to look up._
