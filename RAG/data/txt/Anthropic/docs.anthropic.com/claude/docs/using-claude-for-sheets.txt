You can now call Claude in Google Sheets with the Claude for Sheets extension.
Claude for Sheets enables seamless integration between Claude and Google
Sheets, allowing you to execute interactions with Claude directly in cells.

Installing Claude for Sheets

Easily enable Claude for Sheets using the following steps:

  1. **Get your Claude API key** \- You will not be able to use Claude for Sheets without a developer API key. For more information on how to acquire an API key, see Getting access to Claude.

  2. **Install the Claude for Sheets extension**

    1. Click here to access the Claude for Sheets extension
    2. Click "Install"
  3. **Enable Claude for Sheets**

    1. Open a fresh workbook
    2. Go to _Extensions_ > _Add-ons_ > _Manage add-ons_
    3. Click on the triple dot menu at the top right corner of the Claude for Sheets extension and make sure "Use in this document" is checked

After you see the green 'verified' checkmark ✅ appear, Claude will be
activated and ready within your Google Sheet.

###

Permissions

During installation, the Claude for Sheets extension will ask for a variety of
permissions needed to function properly. Although the permissions requested to
run Claude in Sheets are broad, please be assured that we only process the
specific pieces of data that users ask Claude to run on. This data is never
used to train our generative models.

Extension permissions include:

  * **Connect to an external service** \- needed in order to make calls to the Anthropic API
  * **Allow this application to run when you are not present** \- needed to run cell recalculations without user intervention
  * **See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Sheets spreadsheets** \- needed to perform batch cell updates when recalculating `#ERROR!` cells that have timed out or have been deferred due to API concurrency limits; this service cannot work with permissions given only for the current sheet

> 🚧
>
> Cell Recalculation
>
> Note that you must still manually recalculate cells by selecting from the
> recalculate options within the Claude for Sheets extension menu.

How to use Claude for Sheets

###

Claude functions

There are two main functions you can use to call Claude using Claude for
Sheets:

  1. `=CLAUDE(prompt)` \- this function will automatically wrap your prompt in the proper formatting of `\n\nHuman: ${your_prompt}\n\nAssistant:` for you. To use this function, all you need is a plaintext prompt with no additional formatting. This is the function you'll probably want to use most of the time. This is identical to the Slackbot Claude interface and "Chat" mode on the console.

####

Here is an example CLAUDE prompt

CLAUDE() Example

    
        In one sentence, what is good about the color blue?
    

  2. `=CLAUDEFREE(prompt, model, params...)` \- to use this function, you will have to manually sandwich your prompt between `\n\nHuman:` and `\n\nAssistant:`. Replace `\n\n` with two actual new lines when writing your prompt in a cell.

This is identical to the raw API Claude interface and "Edit Chat" mode on the
console. For more information on the special "Human:"/"Assistant:" formatting
in CLAUDEFREE, see Introduction to Prompt Design.

    1. To make new lines in a cell, do the following:  
**Mac:** Cmd + Enter  
**Windows:** Alt + Enter

####

Here is an example CLAUDEFREE prompt (notice the two new lines before
"Human:")

CLAUDEFREE() Example

    
        
    Human: In one sentence, what is good about the color blue?
      
    Assistant:
    

###

Optional function parameters

If you want to specify API parameters, you can do so by listing "parameter
name" (in quotation marks), "parameter value" at the end of the call. For
example, if you want to set the max_tokens to 3, you can do it as follows:
`=CLAUDE("[your prompt]", "claude-instant-1.2", "max_tokens_to_sample", 3)`.

You can set multiple parameters. Simply list them one after another, each with
a name and value pair separated by commas.  
For example, this is valid CLAUDE function: `=CLAUDE("[your prompt]", "claude-
instant-1.2", "max_tokens_to_sample", 3, "temperature", 0.5)`

**The parameters you might care about most are:**

  * `max_tokens_to_sample` \- the total number of tokens the model outputs before it is forced to stop. For yes/no or multiple choice answers, you probably want 1-2. Otherwise you'll want as many as 200 if you want a long answer.
  * `temperature` \- the amount of randomness injected into results. For multiple-choice or analytical tasks, you'll want it close to 0. For idea generation, you'll want it set to 1.
