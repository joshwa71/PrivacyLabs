If you're asking Claude to perform a complex task that includes many subtasks,
it is helpful to list the subtasks separately .

When you don't know the subtasks well yourself i.e. you're asking Claude to
solve a problem, you can significantly improve the reasoning and accuracy of
the response by explicitly telling Claude to think step-by-step.
