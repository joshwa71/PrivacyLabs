Information Extraction

Prompt for Email Address Extraction

    
    
    
    Human: Please precisely copy any email addresses from the following text and then write them, one per line. Only write an email address if it's precisely spelled out in the input text. If there are no email addresses in the text, write "N/A". Do not say anything else.
    
    {{TEXT}}
    
    Assistant:
    

Explicitly telling Claude not to say anything else is one way to cut out its
natural chattiness.

PII Removal

And here's an example prompt we can use to process the same kind of text, but
this time _removing_ email addresses (and other personally identifiable
information).

Prompt for Removing PII

    
    
    
    Human: Here is some text. We want to remove all personally identifying information from this text and replace it with XXX. It's very important that names, phone numbers, and email addresses, gets replaced with XXX.
    Here is the text, inside <text></text> XML tags
    
    <text>
    {{TEXT}}
    </text>
    
    Please put your sanitized version of the text with PII removed in <response></response> XML tags.
