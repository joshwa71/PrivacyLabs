Claude is a conversational agent, so often it will explain at length why it
selected a given option. If you just want a fast multiple-choice answer and no
explanation, you can use the "`Human:`"/"`Assistant:`" formatting in the API
to put words in Claude's mouth and have Claude respond in a particular way.

For example, if the available options start with `(`, you can end your prompt
with "`Assistant: My answer is (`". That way you can immediately get a
response in the first token.
