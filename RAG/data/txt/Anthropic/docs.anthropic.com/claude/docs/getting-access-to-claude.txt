Anthropic is rolling out Claude slowly and incrementally, as we work to ensure
the safety and scalability of it, in alignment with our company values.

We're working with select partners to roll out Claude in their products. If
you're interested in becoming one of those partners, we are accepting
applications. Keep in mind that, due to the overwhelming interest we've
received so far, we may take a while to reply.

If you have been interacting with Claude via one interface (e.g. Claude in
Slack), and wish to move to another interface (e.g. API access), you may
reapply for access to each product separately.
