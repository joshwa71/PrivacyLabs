#  ü§ó Datasets Server

Datasets Server is a lightweight web API for visualizing and exploring all
types of datasets - computer vision, speech, text, and tabular - stored on the
Hugging Face Hub.

The main feature of the Datasets Server is to auto-convert all the Hub
datasets to Parquet. Read more in the Parquet section.

As datasets increase in size and data type richness, the cost of preprocessing
(storage and compute) these datasets can be challenging and time-consuming. To
help users access these modern datasets, Datasets Server runs a server behind
the scenes to generate the API responses ahead of time and stores them in a
database so they are instantly returned when you make a query through the API.

Let Datasets Server take care of the heavy lifting so you can use a simple
**REST API** on any of the **30,000+ datasets on Hugging Face** to:

  * List the **dataset splits, column names and data types**
  * Get the **dataset size** (in number of rows or bytes)
  * Download and view **rows at any index** in the dataset
  * **Search** a word in the dataset
  * Get insightful **statistics** about the data
  * Access the dataset as **parquet files** to use in your favorite **processing or analytics framework**
