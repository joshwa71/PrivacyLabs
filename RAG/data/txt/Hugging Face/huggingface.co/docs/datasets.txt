ü§ó Datasets is a library for easily accessing and sharing datasets for Audio,
Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

Load a dataset in a single line of code, and use our powerful data processing
methods to quickly get your dataset ready for training in a deep learning
model. Backed by the Apache Arrow format, process large datasets with zero-
copy reads without any memory constraints for optimal speed and efficiency. We
also feature a deep integration with the Hugging Face Hub, allowing you to
easily load and share a dataset with the wider machine learning community.

Find your dataset today on the Hugging Face Hub, and take an in-depth look
inside of it with the live viewer.

Tutorials
