`timm` is a library containing SOTA computer vision models, layers, utilities,
optimizers, schedulers, data-loaders, augmentations, and training/evaluation
scripts.

It comes packaged with >700 pretrained models, and is designed to be flexible
and easy to use.

Read the quick start guide to get up and running with the `timm` library. You
will learn how to load, discover, and use pretrained models included in the
library.
