#  ðŸ¤— Evaluate

A library for easily evaluating machine learning models and datasets.

With a single line of code, you get access to dozens of evaluation methods for
different domains (NLP, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and more!).
Be it on your local machine or in a distributed training setup, you can
evaluate your models in a consistent and reproducible way!

Visit the ðŸ¤— Evaluate organization for a full list of available metrics. Each
metric has a dedicated Space with an interactive demo for how to use the
metric, and a documentation card detailing the metrics limitations and usage.
