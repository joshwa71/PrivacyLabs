#  Hugging Face Hub documentation

The Hugging Face Hub is a platform with over 350k models, 75k datasets, and
150k demo apps (Spaces), all open source and publicly available, in an online
platform where people can easily collaborate and build ML together. The Hub
works as a central place where anyone can explore, experiment, collaborate,
and build technology with Machine Learning. Are you ready to join the path
towards open source Machine Learning? ü§ó

Code of Conduct Content Guidelines

##  What‚Äôs the Hugging Face Hub?

We are helping the community work together towards the goal of advancing
Machine Learning üî•.

The Hugging Face Hub is a platform with over 120k models, 20k datasets, and
50k demos in which people can easily collaborate in their ML workflows. The
Hub works as a central place where anyone can share, explore, discover, and
experiment with open-source Machine Learning.

No single company, including the Tech Titans, will be able to ‚Äúsolve AI‚Äù by
themselves ‚Äì the only way we‚Äôll achieve this is by sharing knowledge and
resources in a community-centric approach. We are building the largest open-
source collection of models, datasets, demos and metrics on the Hugging Face
Hub to democratize and advance ML for everyone üöÄ.

We encourage you to read the Code of Conduct and the Content Guidelines to
familiarize yourself with the values that we expect our community members to
uphold ü§ó.

##  What can you find on the Hub?

The Hugging Face Hub hosts Git-based repositories, which are version-
controlled buckets that can contain all your files. üíæ

On it, you‚Äôll be able to upload and discover‚Ä¶

  * Models, _hosting the latest state-of-the-art models for NLP, vision, and audio tasks_
  * Datasets, _featuring a wide variety of data for different domains and modalities_..
  * Spaces, _interactive apps for demonstrating ML models directly in your browser_.

The Hub offers **versioning, commit history, diffs, branches, and over a dozen
library integrations**! You can learn more about the features that all
repositories share in the **Repositories documentation**.

##  Models

You can discover and use dozens of thousands of open-source ML models shared
by the community. To promote responsible model usage and development, model
repos are equipped with Model Cards to inform users of each model‚Äôs
limitations and biases. Additional metadata about info such as their tasks,
languages, and metrics can be included, with training metrics charts even
added if the repository contains TensorBoard traces. It‚Äôs also easy to add an
**inference widget** to your model, allowing anyone to play with the model
directly in the browser! For programmatic access, an API is provided to
**instantly serve your model**.

To upload models to the Hub, or download models and integrate them into your
work, explore the **Models documentation**. You can also choose from **over a
dozen libraries** such as ü§ó Transformers, Asteroid, and ESPnet that support
the Hub.

##  Datasets

The Hub is home to over 5,000 datasets in more than 100 languages that can be
used for a broad range of tasks across NLP, Computer Vision, and Audio. The
Hub makes it simple to find, download, and upload datasets. Datasets are
accompanied by extensive documentation in the form of **Dataset Cards** and
**Dataset Preview** to let you explore the data directly in your browser.
While many datasets are public, **organizations** and individuals can create
private datasets to comply with licensing or privacy issues. You can learn
more about **Datasets here on Hugging Face Hub documentation**.

The ü§ó `datasets` library allows you to programmatically interact with the
datasets, so you can easily use datasets from the Hub in your projects. With a
single line of code, you can access the datasets; even if they are so large
they don‚Äôt fit in your computer, you can use streaming to efficiently access
the data.

##  Spaces

Spaces is a simple way to host ML demo apps on the Hub. They allow you to
build your ML portfolio, showcase your projects at conferences or to
stakeholders, and work collaboratively with other people in the ML ecosystem.

We currently support two awesome Python SDKs ( **Gradio** and **Streamlit** )
that let you build cool apps in a matter of minutes. Users can also create
static Spaces which are simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript page within a Space.

After you‚Äôve explored a few Spaces (take a look at our Space of the Week!),
dive into the **Spaces documentation** to learn all about how you can create
your own Space. You‚Äôll also be able to upgrade your Space to run on a GPU or
other accelerated hardware. ‚ö°Ô∏è

##  Organizations

Companies, universities and non-profits are an essential part of the Hugging
Face community! The Hub offers **Organizations**, which can be used to group
accounts and manage datasets, models, and Spaces. Educators can also create
collaborative organizations for students using Hugging Face for Classrooms. An
organization‚Äôs repositories will be featured on the organization‚Äôs page and
every member of the organization will have the ability to contribute to the
repository. In addition to conveniently grouping all of an organization‚Äôs
work, the Hub allows admins to set roles to **control access to
repositories**, and manage their organization‚Äôs payment method and billing
info. Machine Learning is more fun when collaborating! üî•

Explore existing organizations, create a new organization here, and then visit
the **Organizations documentation** to learn more.

##  Security

The Hugging Face Hub supports security and access control features to give you
the peace of mind that your code, models, and data are safe. Visit the
**Security** section in these docs to learn about:

  * User Access Tokens
  * Access Control for Organizations
  * Signing commits with GPG
  * Malware scanning
